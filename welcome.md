# C# Data Structures Tutorials

This is a learning guide for three (3) different data structures that exist in the world of programming. Although this tutorial is given in C#, the structures exist in all programming languages in some way. 

Data structures are crucial to modern programming. They allow easier, safer and quicker solutions to issues both common and uncommonly found in the work place. Understanding and being able to properly use data structures will propel your ability to code and overall make you a better programmer and problem solver. 

Well, then, let's get started! There are three structures we will be focusing on in this tutorial: 

1. [Stacks](stack/stack_reading.md)
2. [Linked Lists](linked_list/linked_list_reading.md)
3. [Tree](tree/tree_reading.md)

If you're wanting to be successful in this tutorial, you'll want to have the following skills already under your belt: 

* Basic programming concepts (writing and debugging code, loops, conditional statements)
* Basic understanding of the C# language and syntax

If that sounds like you, then letting get coding!

Each lesson in the tutorial will have an explanation of the topic, examples and a coding challenge at the end as well as a solution to the challenge. Do your best to solve the challenge by yourself first. If you can't solve it in 60 minutes, then take a look at the solution for guidance. Once you've completed the challenge, be sure to look over the solution to check your work and/or see another possible way of solving the challenge.
